## Summary
- We propose TEST, which employs three transformer-based architecture variants, to conduct temporal action localization.
- The three transformer-based architectures can effectively improve localization performance and space-time efficiency.
- We propose to integrate the results from multiple feature maps to obtain more comprehensive predictions.
- Extensive experiments on two real-world benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed TEST.


## Getting Start
TBD


## Updating
- 20241006: We uploaded the initial codes without details. We plan to upload the complete codes and details by November.
