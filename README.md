# Test: Temporal-Spatial Separated Transformer for Temporal Action Localization

This is an official implementation in PyTorch of TeST. Our paper is available at [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4837237](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4837237).

## Summary
- We propose TEST, which employs three transformer-based architecture variants, to conduct temporal action localization.
- The three transformer-based architectures can effectively improve localization performance and space-time efficiency.
- We propose to integrate the results from multiple feature maps to obtain more comprehensive predictions.
- Extensive experiments on two real-world benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed TEST.
